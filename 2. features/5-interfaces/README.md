# Interface
    Creates a new type, describing the property names and value types of an object

## Why do we care 
General strategy for reusable code in TS
* Create functions that accept arguments that are typed with interfaces
* Object/Classes can decide to 'implement' a given interface to work witha function

Used as a gatekeeper for  some specific function
