## Type annotations

### For Variables: 
    Code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to
### For Functions:
    Code we add to tell TS what type of arguments a function will receive and what tyep of values it will return

## When to use Type Annotations

* When we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
* When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
* When a function returns the 'any' type, and we need to clarify the value

# Type Inference

### For Variables:
    TS tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

### For Functions:
    TS tries to figure out what type of value a function will return

### When to use Type Inference: Always!
