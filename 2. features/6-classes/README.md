# Classes
    Blueprint to create an object with some fields(values) and methods(functions) to represent a 'thing'

## Modifiers
* Public: This method can be called anywhere and anytime
* Private: This method can only be called by other method inside this class
* Protected: This method can be called by other methods in this class, or by other methods in child class

## Why do we care about classes

We use everywhere inside any base application.
